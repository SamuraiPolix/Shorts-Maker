        "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.",
        "God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?",
        "And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”",
        "Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.",
        "And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,",
        "Because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel,",
        "But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:"
