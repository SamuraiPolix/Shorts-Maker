        "Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.",
        "We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.",
        "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.",

        "Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in you.",
        "For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?",
        "But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.",
        "Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.",
        "But the Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love.",
        "But I will hope continually and will praise you yet more and more.",

        "For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.",
        "There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call—",
        "For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.",
        "But as for me, I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.",
        "Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.",
        "In hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began",
        "And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security.",
        "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.",
        "Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; for you I wait all the day long.",
        "But Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.",
        "But, as it is written, “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him”—",
        "If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.",
        "For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him.",
        "Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God,",
        "O Israel, hope in the Lord! For with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with him is plentiful redemption.",
        "Who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.",
        "O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted; you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear",
        "But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.",
        "Since we have such a hope, we are very bold,",
        "For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.",
        "My soul longs for your salvation; I hope in your word.",
        "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,",
        "Though he slay me, I will hope in him; yet I will argue my ways to his face.",
        "In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.”",
        "God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?",
        "And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”",
        "Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.",
        "And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,",
        "Because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel,",
