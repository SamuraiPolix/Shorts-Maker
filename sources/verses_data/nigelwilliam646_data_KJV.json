        "My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.",
        "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.",
        "This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.",
        "Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.",
        "And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.",
        "He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.",
        "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,",

        "No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.",
        "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.",
        "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.",
        "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.",
        "And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.",
        "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.",
        "The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.",
        "Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.",
        "No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.",

        "And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.",
        "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.",
        "Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.",
        "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?",
        "Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.",
        "Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.",
        "For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use  not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.",
        "Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.",
        "And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.",
        "Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,",
        "And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christâ€™s sake hath forgiven you.",
        "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.",
        "This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.",
        "Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.",
        "I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.",
        "For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:",
        "How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!",
        "Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.",
        "My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.",
        "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:",
        "Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.",
        "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is  better than wine.",
        "Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.",
        "And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour."
